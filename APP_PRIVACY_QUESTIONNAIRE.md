# App Privacy Questionnaire Draft

This draft assumes the current app behavior (no analytics SDK, no login, no ads, no external tracking).

## Data Collection
Expected answer: No data collected.

Why:
- No account creation.
- No analytics SDK.
- No ad network SDK.
- No third-party tracking identifiers.
- Question text is handled locally on-device.

## Tracking
Expected answer: No, this app does not track users.

## Sensitive APIs / Permissions
Current web app logic does not require:
- Camera
- Microphone
- Contacts
- Location
- Photos

If you later add any of the above, this questionnaire must be updated.

## Notes
Speech synthesis and audio playback are local platform capabilities and do not require declaring user tracking.
